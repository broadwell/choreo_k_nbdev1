## Try

The full Python code package documented here is still under development. To try out the pose analysis code in the meantime, we recommend opening the notebook at [examples/Pose_analysis_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/broadwell/choreo_k/blob/main/examples/Pose_analysis_examples.ipynb). The code is most likely to work in Google Colab:
